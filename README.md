- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3
- Step 4

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>
Now, set up your Windows virtual machine. Make sure all your systems are placed in the same location (called a region) so they can work together easily.

When you're creating the virtual machine:

Choose the Resource Group you made earlier. This helps keep everything organized.

Let the system create a new Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnet for you. Think of these like a private network that your virtual machine will use to communicate.

When you get to the Administrator Account section, be sure to set your username and password.
